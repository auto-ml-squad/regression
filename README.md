# regression
Multivariable System Identification

The goal of the project is to developed in Python different parameter estimators of dynamic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) regression models in parameter matrix (PM) and in parameter vector (PV) form.

The following estimators are developed in Matlab: 
	lspm 	- Least Squares (LS) for models in PM form
	lspv 	- LS for models in PV form
	elspm 	- Extended LS (ELS) for models in PM form
	elspv 	- ELS for models in PV form
	roblspm - Robust LS (RobLS) for models in PM form
	roblspv - RobLS for models in PV form
	wlspv 	- Weighted LS (WLS) for models in PV form

This code is used as benchmark for the development in Python. Also, the estimators:
	wlspm 	- WLS for models in PM form
	ivpm 	- Instrumental Variable (IV) for models in PM form
	ivpv 	- IV  for models in PV form
	other estimators...
are still not developed in matlab but should be written in Python.

Additionally for testing purposes are created the following Matlab scripts
	main_lspm
	main_lspv
	main_elspm
	main_elspv
	main_roblspm
	main_roblspv
	main_wlspv

The main scripts:
	main_lspm
	main_ivpm
	main_ivpv
	other scripts for testing...
are still not developed in Matlab but should be written in Python.
