# regression
Multivariable System Identification

The goal of the project is to developed in Python different parameter estimators of dynamic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) regression models in parameter matrix (PM) and in parameter vector (PV) form.

The following estimators are developed in Matlab:  <br>
	lspm.m		- Least Squares (LS) for models in PM form <br>
	lspv.m		- LS for models in PV form <br>
	elspm.m		- Extended LS (ELS) for models in PM form <br>
	elspv.m		- ELS for models in PV form <br>
	roblspm.m	- Robust LS (RobLS) for models in PM form <br>
	roblspv.m	- RobLS for models in PV form <br>
	wlspv.m		- Weighted LS (WLS) for models in PV form <br>
<p>
This code is used as benchmark for the development in Python. Also, the estimators: <br>
	wlspm.m 	- WLS for models in PM form <br>
	ivpm.m		- Instrumental Variable (IV) for models in PM form <br>
	ivpv.m		- IV  for models in PV form <br>
	other estimators... <br>
are still not developed in matlab but should be written in Python.
<p>
Additionally for testing purposes are created the following Matlab scripts <br>
	main_lspm.m <br>
	main_lspv.m <br>
	main_elspm.m <br>
	main_elspv.m <br>
	main_roblspm.m <br>
	main_roblspv.m <br>
	main_wlspv.m <br>
<p>
The main scripts: <br>
	main_lspm.m <br>
	main_ivpm.m <br>
	main_ivpv.m <br>
	other scripts for testing... <br>
are still not developed in Matlab but should be written in Python. <br>
